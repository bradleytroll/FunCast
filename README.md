# Funcast: Current Theme Park Wait Times and Weather

Funcast is a web application designed to enhance the theme park experience by providing current wait times for attractions and weather updates. This tool is perfect for on-the-go theme park enthusiasts who want to maximize their day by making quick decisions about which park to visit or which attraction to enjoy using consistently-updated wait times and weather information.

## Bradley Troll - Individual Changes

Based on some feedback from our presentation and my own preferences, I've made a few changes to the code. I've cleaned up some language for readability sake. I've removed some graphic elements I found distracting. Additionally, I updated the code so that the recently-searched theme parks only appear after a user has searched for a park. I've updated the deployment link at the end of this readme; otherwise, the readme below is identical to the group presentation.
